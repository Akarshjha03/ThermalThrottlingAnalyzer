**Thermal Throttling Analyzer (TTA)** is a powerful, lightweight, and Windows-only CLI diagnostic tool built in Go. It empowers developers, gamers, and power users to detect, analyze, and explain CPU thermal throttling events in real-time.

## 🚀 Project Idea & Use Cases

Modern CPUs invoke thermal throttling to protect themselves from overheating, but this often results in unexplained performance drops (FPS lag, compile time slowdowns). **TTA** bridges the gap between raw sensor data and actionable insights.

### Common Use Cases:
- **Gamers**: Diagnose why your frame rate suddenly drops after 30 minutes of gameplay.
- **Developers**: Understand if thermal limits are affecting your compile times or render jobs.
- **Overclockers**: Verify system stability and cooling efficiency under load.
- **SysAdmins**: Quick health checks on Windows servers without heavy GUI tools.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- **🔥 Real-time Monitoring**: Watch CPU state, temperature, and frequency live.
- **📊 Historical Analysis**: Analyze past logs to correlate slowdowns with thermal events.
- **🏥 Doctor Mode**: One-command system health check.
- **📉 Throttling Detection**: Smart state machine detects when and why throttling occurs.
- **🎈 Lightweight**: Zero dependencies, single binary executable.

2.  Open your terminal in the download folder.
3.  Run `.\tta.exe`.

### Option 2: Build from Source
Requirements: Go 1.21+

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Akarshjha03/ThermalThrottlingAnalyzer.git
cd ThermalThrottlingAnalyzer
go mod tidy
go build -o tta.exe ./cmd/tta
```

### Option 3: Go Install

## 🛠️ Commands

### 1. View Available Commands
Run the root command to see the ASCII banner and list of all supported commands.
```bash
tta
```
*Output: Displays a custom ASCII banner followed by the help menu.*

### 2. Check System Status
Quickly verify if your system is currently throttling or healthy.
```bash
tta status
```
*Output: "Thermal State: NORMAL" or "Thermal State: THROTTLING"*

### 3. Live Monitoring
Watch your CPU metrics update in real-time with a fire animation when throttling occurs.
```bash
tta watch
```

### 4. Analyze History
Investigate what happened in the last few hours.
```bash
tta analyze --last 2h
```

### 5. Health Check (Doctor)
Run a comprehensive diagnostic of your thermal sensors and configuration.
```bash
tta doctor
```

### 6. View Logs
Dump raw event logs for external processing.
```bash
tta log --today
```

### 7. Other Commands
*   `tta completion`: Generate the autocompletion script for the specified shell.
*   `tta help`: Help about any command.
